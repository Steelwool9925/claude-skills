## Constraint — read this first

**This skill writes exactly one report file per run — plus, in `--e2e` mode only, a regenerated
`ONBOARDING.md` — and publishes exactly one Artifact page: a plain-English writeup for the people
who'll use what was tested. It never edits source, and it never learns the feature from source.**

Kevin is a user, not a code reviewer. He only knows what the plan's acceptance criteria say the
feature should let him do — never the File Impact Manifest, never a diff, never an implementation
file. Reading source to "understand the feature better" is exactly the shortcut a real first-time
user doesn't have, and it's off-limits here for the same reason `test-feature` can't skip an
evaluation vector: it would produce evidence about a persona this skill isn't running.

Checking what the feature touches (§3c) works the same way §6.3's cross-domain journey already
does — via `map.mjs edges` against the codebase map, never the diff or File Impact Manifest. Map
edges describe structure (which domains connect), not implementation; reading them isn't reading
source.

Usage:
  `/kevin --plan <path to FEATURE_PLAN_<Name>.md> [--url <base-url>]` — single feature, plan-driven
  `/kevin --domain <name> [--url <base-url>]` — single map domain, no plan needed
  `/kevin --e2e [--url <base-url>]` — whole project, every domain plus a cross-domain journey

Artifact paths, `<Name>` derivation and repo resolution come from
`~/.claude/skills/_shared/pipeline-contract.md`. The model floor in §0b comes from
`~/.claude/skills/_shared/complexity-scoring.md`.

## 0 — Gate

**Pick the mode from how kevin was invoked**, then jump to the matching lookup below. §1
(get the app running), §2 (persona) and §2b (every avenue) apply to every mode; §3–§5 (including
§3c, interacting features) are the single-feature/domain report format, replaced by §6 for `--e2e`
(§6.3 runs the same interacting-feature check, across every confirmed edge, for that mode).

| Invocation | Lookup |
|---|---|
| `--plan <path>`, a named feature, or bare `/kevin` | **Locate the plan**, below |
| `--domain <name>` | **Map lookup**, below |
| `--e2e` | Skip both lookups — go straight to §6 |

### Locate the plan

- In order:
  1. An explicit `--plan` argument.
  2. If the invocation names a specific feature, search `.claude/plans/FEATURE_PLAN_*.md` (the
     container too, in a workspace) for a plan matching it — by title or filename, not necessarily
     an exact string match ("test the tag scan feature" should find a plan named `patrol-scan-*`,
     not only one literally titled "tag scan"). More than one plausible match → ask which one,
     listing the candidates.
  3. A feature was named but no plan matches it → run the **Map lookup** below instead of asking
     — same as `--domain` would, matched against the named feature. Note in the report that no
     formal plan existed and this ran from the map instead.
  4. No feature was named at all (a bare `/kevin`) → the newest `.claude/plans/FEATURE_PLAN_*.md`
     (container too, in a workspace), as before.
  5. Still nothing usable → ask.
- **Read only what a user brief would contain:** the title, the acceptance criteria, and the
  selected tier's milestones, described functionally. **Do not open the File Impact Manifest, any
  file it lists, or the diff.** Stop reading once you have the functional description — don't keep
  scanning into the manifest "while you're there."
- If the plan names more than one repo, the frontend-facing repo is the one in scope. Say which
  one and why.

### Map lookup (`--domain <name>`, or a named feature with no matching plan)

- Read `.claude/maps/index.md` (the container too, in a workspace) and match `<name>` against the
  domain table — by domain name first, then by what a flow's title or purpose describes, the same
  loose match **Locate the plan** uses for a feature name. More than one plausible match → ask,
  listing the candidates. No match at all → list the domains the index actually has and ask.
- Read only that domain's `.claude/maps/<domain>.md` — the `## Flow:` purpose, in/out and call
  order **as a description of what the feature does**, never as a set of files to open. This is
  the same altitude a plan's acceptance criteria would give Kevin; the map's `## Structure` and
  file paths are exactly the shortcut §2 already forbids taking from a plan's manifest.
- A domain lists more than one `## Flow:` — test all of them unless `<name>` clearly named one
  specific flow, in which case test only that one. Each flow gets its own Coverage/Issues entry in
  §4, same file.
- `<Name>` for the report and announcement is the domain's own kebab-case name (already
  kebab-case per `map-codebase`'s domain-naming convention) unless a matched feature name gives a
  more specific one.

## 0b — Model floor

Look the required tier up deterministically rather than re-reading the table by eye:

```bash
# --plan or --domain mode — flat floor regardless of the plan's Complexity score
node ~/.claude/skills/tooling/cli.mjs complexity-scoring.modelForGate '["gradingLevel", null, {"mode":"kevin-plan-or-domain"}]'
# --e2e mode — pass the domain count §6.1's cost checkpoint already computed
node ~/.claude/skills/tooling/cli.mjs complexity-scoring.modelForGate '["gradingLevel", null, {"mode":"kevin-e2e", "domainCount":<n>}]'
```

`--plan` mode: the plan's `**Complexity:**` line (already extracted while **Locate the plan** ran
above) doesn't change this gate — `kevin-plan-or-domain` is a flat Sonnet 5 floor regardless of
score, the same floor `--domain` mode gets, which has no plan and therefore no complexity line at
all.

`--e2e` mode returns Sonnet 5 at or below ~5 domains and Opus 5 above it — §6.1's cost checkpoint
already counts the domains, so check the floor there in the same breath as naming the cost. This is
a hard gate, same as every other row in this table: no silently running an `--e2e` pass over five
domains on Sonnet because the count "felt close enough."

Check the required tier against the model actually powering this session. If it falls short, tell
the user and ask them to switch (`/model`) before proceeding, and wait — don't run an `--e2e` pass
or grade a High-complexity plan under a lower tier "just this once." If they explicitly choose to
proceed anyway, note it in the report's header.

**Split-execution alternative (`--e2e`, >~5 domains).** The Opus floor above attaches to §6.3's
cross-domain journey and §6.4/§6.5's consolidated synthesis, not to covering many domains at all
(see `complexity-scoring.md`'s Grading-level use section). Offer, alongside the plain model-switch
ask, running §6.2's per-domain coverage as a series of separate passes under `--domain` mode's own
flat Sonnet-5 floor — then switching to Opus 5 only for the journey and consolidation. §6.1 has the
mechanics; this still leaves the aggregate synthesis step gated at Opus 5, unchanged.

## 1 — Get the app running

Invoke the `run` skill to launch, or confirm, the app. If it needs a base URL you don't have,
**hard pause** and ask rather than guessing a port.

**Establish the browser surface before anything else — do not assume a tool name.** Kevin cannot
run without one, and which one is present varies by machine and by session. Check, in order, and use
the first that is actually available:

1. **Claude in Chrome** — the `claude-in-chrome` skill plus `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools. Invoke
   the skill before touching any of its tools; it gates on site permissions that must be set up
   first.
2. **Chrome DevTools MCP** — the `chrome-devtools-mcp:chrome-devtools` skill plus
   `mcp__*chrome-devtools__*` tools (`navigate_page`, `click`, `fill`, `take_snapshot`,
   `take_screenshot`). Invoke that skill first for the same reason.

**Neither available → stop and say so.** Name which surface you looked for and ask the user to
enable one. Do not fall back to `curl`, to reading source, or to reasoning about what the UI probably
does — a Kevin report is only worth anything if a real browser actually drove the real app, and an
imagined pass is worse than no report. This is the same hard-pause as a missing base URL above.

**Test data only.** Never submit to a real payment processor, a real outbound email/SMS
recipient, or anything that notifies a real third party. If the flow requires one of these, ask
for a safe target (sandbox mode, a test card, an address you control) before proceeding.

**Native mobile frontend (nothing a browser surface can reach).** Before writing that ground off
as unreachable, check for a connected device: `adb devices` (Android SDK platform-tools; if `adb`
isn't on `PATH`, it's usually under the SDK's `platform-tools/` — locate it once, then prepend it
for the rest of the run). A connected, authorized device — physical or emulator — turns the mobile
frontend from unreachable into drivable, the same way a running dev server does for a web app:

- Launch / kill: `adb shell am start -n <package>/<activity>`,
  `adb shell am force-stop <package>` (`adb shell cmd package resolve-activity --brief <package>`
  finds the launcher activity if you don't already know it).
- Act: `adb shell input tap <x> <y>`, `adb shell input text "..."`, `adb shell input keyevent
  KEYCODE_BACK` (and other `KEYCODE_*` as needed).
- Look: `adb exec-out screencap -p > file.png`, then read the PNG — there's no accessibility-tree
  snapshot like `take_snapshot`, so screenshot before *and* after each action rather than guessing
  coordinates blind. `adb shell uiautomator dump` gives an XML layout dump when a screenshot alone
  doesn't pin down where to tap.
- Toggle device state the feature depends on: `adb shell svc nfc enable|disable`, `adb shell svc
  wifi enable|disable`, `adb shell svc data enable|disable`, etc.
- Same rules as §2 apply here too: mistake-then-correct passes, and never fake a physical action a
  real user can't skip — a real NFC/QR scan needs a real tag against real hardware; don't call the
  scan endpoint directly to simulate one, and don't treat a `uiautomator`/`adb shell input` route
  around a stuck screen as anything but a finding. The same real-third-party-notification rule
  applies too — a live Panic/SOS-style control is exactly as off-limits here as a real payment or
  email field on the web.
- No device connected, or the installed build obviously doesn't match the plan under test (wrong
  version, wrong branch) → mark that ground unreachable as before. Don't build, install, or side-
  load anything, and don't stand up an emulator yourself unless asked — note in the report what a
  device/build would need to be to close the gap.

## 2 — The Kevin persona

Kevin knows *what* the feature is for — the plan told him that much, the way a colleague might
say "there's a new way to export invoices now." He's **never used this UI before** and treats
every screen as unfamiliar. He isn't stupid, just careless and impatient: he skims labels, trusts
his first guess over reading instructions, and would rather try something than read a tooltip.

**At every step of the flow, do it wrong at least once before doing it correctly.** Pick whichever
of these fits the step, vary it across the run, then also do the correct version so the flow can
continue:

- Submit the step empty, or with only some fields filled.
- Enter the wrong kind of input for a field (letters in a number field, a past date where a
  future one is required, an over-long string, emoji, leading/trailing whitespace).
- Double-click submit, or submit twice in two tabs.
- Navigate away mid-flow (browser back, close a modal, refresh) and come back.
- Upload or paste the wrong kind of thing where a specific format is expected.
- Ignore an inline validation hint and submit anyway.
- Resize to a mobile viewport partway through, or zoom in heavily.
- Click a control that looks disabled, or looks like it does something else.

Skip the mistake pass on a step only when no plausible mistake exists (a step with no input to get
wrong) — never skip because the correct-only pass is faster.

**Interact only through the rendered page** — clicks, typing, keyboard, scroll — exactly what a
mouse-and-keyboard user could do. Never call an API directly, edit `localStorage`/cookies/network
requests to force a state, or open devtools to route around a stuck UI. If Kevin would be stuck, a
real user would be stuck too — that's a finding, not an obstacle to work around.

**On the correct-usage pass, capture one screenshot per major step.** These feed the how-to steps
in §5 (or §6.5's onboarding doc, in `--e2e` mode) — take them once the screen is in the clean, expected state (no validation errors, no
half-filled fields), and reuse the same screenshots from the plan's happy path if a step also gets
one in the Issues section.

**Diagnostics Kevin can't see are still evidence, never a shortcut.** Console errors and failed
network requests are fair to record alongside a symptom Kevin *did* notice on-screen — they
explain *why* the button did nothing. Never use them to figure out *how* to operate the feature.

| Temptation under time pressure | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Let me check the component for the right field name" | That's the shortcut a real user doesn't have. Guess from the label, like Kevin would. |
| "Happy path first to save time, mistakes after" | Order doesn't matter, but skipping the mistake pass on a step does — cover it before moving on. |
| "This step obviously has no wrong way to do it" | Try anyway once — empty submit, double-click, back button. Only skip after actually trying. |
| "It's clearly a network issue, not worth a full repro" | Record it with repro steps anyway — `/execute-plan` needs steps, not a guess at the cause. |

## 2b — Every avenue (all modes)

One correct route plus one mistake per step isn't full coverage if the step actually offers more
than one legitimate way through it. Before calling a step covered:

- Where a step has more than one legitimate way to complete it — a menu action and its keyboard
  shortcut, a single-item form and a bulk-upload equivalent, "save as draft" vs "submit" — exercise
  each route at least once, not just whichever one comes first.
- Where the acceptance criteria describe multiple valid input types or user states (e.g. "accepts
  CSV or JSON", "works for both new and returning users"), cover each variant, not just one
  representative case.
- This is in addition to §2's deliberate-mistake pass, not a replacement for it — a step still gets
  a wrong attempt *and* every legitimate route tried correctly.

Skip this only when a step genuinely has just one way to do it — never because trying every avenue
is slower than trying one.

## 3 — Coverage (`--plan` and `--domain` modes)

Work through every acceptance criterion and milestone in the plan's selected tier (or, in
`--domain` mode, every `## Flow:` read in §0's Map lookup), applying the persona in §2 and the
every-avenue coverage in §2b to each. Note in the report whether it was exercised, partially
exercised (the flow broke before reaching it), or unreachable.

**Also run the whole thing start to finish.** Covering each criterion individually isn't the same
as covering the feature — on the correct-usage pass, complete the entire flow beginning to end in
one continuous run, exactly as a real user finishing the whole feature would, so that hand-offs
between steps (state carried from one screen to the next, a value entered early that's used later)
get exercised too, not just each step in isolation.

## 3b — UI/UX rating (`--plan` and `--domain` modes)

Rate what was actually experienced — don't re-run the flow for this, score what §2/§3 already
surfaced.

**Persona score (1–5).** How much friction a careless first-time user actually hit: 5 is
frictionless and intuitive, 1 is confusing throughout. Base it on the density and severity of
Confusing/Critical findings from §3, not a fresh judgment call — one line naming what drove the
score.

**Expert critique.** Invoke the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill (`Skill` tool) against the *clean* screenshots
captured in §2's correct-usage pass — never a mistake/error-state capture, those show the app
mid-fault, not its design. Ask it to assess visual design and accessibility (contrast, spacing,
tap targets, labeling), and — **only when the plan being tested carries a `## Design Direction`**
— whether the live UI actually matches it (style, palette, typography, component patterns). In
`--domain` mode, or a `--plan` run whose plan has no Design Direction, mark that check "n/a — no
Design Direction to check against" rather than inventing one to compare.

**Correction Plan entries.** A concrete violation from the expert critique — fails a stated
accessibility guideline, contradicts the plan's Design Direction — gets its own `[UI/UX]`-tagged
entry in §4's Correction Plan. A subjective style preference with no concrete violation behind it
stays in this section only; it does not become a Correction Plan entry.

## 3c — Interacting features (`--plan` and `--domain` modes)

A feature rarely stands alone in what it touches. Before closing out the report, confirm the ground
around the tested feature still holds up — not just the feature itself:

- Run `map.mjs edges` (the same tool §6.3 uses) for candidate couplings between the tested
  domain/flow and any other domain — shared auth, a sequential business process, shared
  data/queue/route names.
- **Confirm each candidate is real before treating it as in scope** — per `pipeline-contract.md`,
  edges are candidates, not conclusions, and the same string can appear in two domains by
  coincidence.
- For **every** confirmed edge (not just one), drive that other domain's affected flow through the
  UI far enough to confirm it still completes correctly. This is a regression check, not a fresh
  persona run of that domain — a correct-usage-only pass is enough, §2b's every-avenue and §2's
  mistake pass aren't required there.
- Record each one under a **Touched Features** line in the report's Coverage section: which
  interacting flow was checked, and whether it still works.
- A regression found here — the tested feature works, but something it touches now doesn't — is a
  **Critical** issue in §4, same severity rules as any other finding.
- No confirmed edges at all → say so ("no interacting domains found") rather than skipping the
  section silently.

## 4 — Output (`--plan` and `--domain` modes)

Write `.claude/reports/KEVIN_REPORT_<Name>.md`:

```markdown
# Kevin Report — <Name>
Plan: <path, or "none — sourced from map files (<paths>)" per §0's Map lookup>   URL: <base-url>   Generated: <ISO date>

## Verdict
<one line: usable / confusing in places / broken>

## Coverage
<checklist of acceptance criteria / milestones — exercised / partial / unreachable, and why>

## Touched Features
<per confirmed map edge: interacting domain/flow checked, and whether it still works — or "no interacting domains found">

## Issues
1. **[Critical|Confusing|Minor]** <title>
   - Steps: <numbered, first-person, exactly what Kevin clicked/typed>
   - Expected: <what a first-time user would reasonably expect>
   - Actual: <what happened, plus any console/network evidence>
   - Screenshot: <path/description, if captured>

## UI/UX Rating
**Persona score:** <1-5> — <one-line rationale, drawn from Issues above>
**Expert critique (ui-ux-pro-max):**
  - Visual design: <notes>
  - Accessibility: <notes>
  - Consistency with Design Direction: <match / mismatch, with specifics — or "n/a — no Design Direction to check against">
**Overall:** <1-5>

## Correction Plan
1. [repo] <atomic fix — area if inferable from the symptom, what, why>
2. [repo] [UI/UX] <atomic fix, from a concrete expert-critique violation only>
3. ...
```

Severity: **Critical** blocks completing the flow at all. **Confusing** lets Kevin finish, but
only after real friction — a wrong error message, a dead end with no way back, a control that does
the opposite of what it looks like. **Minor** is cosmetic, a small papercut.

The **Correction Plan** mirrors `test-feature`'s — numbered, atomic, each naming the repo in a
workspace — but drawn from usability symptoms observed through the UI, not from a diff. Where the
underlying cause isn't visible from the frontend, say so and describe the symptom precisely enough
for a developer to locate it.

For a cross-repo feature, the report goes to `<container>/.claude/reports/KEVIN_REPORT_<Name>.md`.

## 5 — Feature announcement (`--plan` and `--domain` modes only — `--e2e` uses §6.5 instead)

Once the report is written, publish a second, separate deliverable: a plain-English page telling
end users what the feature is and how to use it. This is for the people who'll click the button,
not the developer reading the Correction Plan — a different audience from the report in §4.

- **Source it from the same functional description read in §0** — the plan's title and acceptance
  criteria — never from the report's issues, the diff, or the File Impact Manifest.
- **Never mention this skill's name, that a persona or UAT pass ran, bugs found, screenshots,
  severities, or anything about testing, QA, or the pipeline.** Write it the way a product team
  would write a help page or release note: what's new, then how to use it as numbered, everyday
  steps — no internal jargon, no code, no file paths.
- Load the `artifact-design` skill before drafting the page, then write the HTML to a temp file
  (the scratchpad directory) and publish it with the `Artifact` tool. Give it a title naming the
  feature (never this skill's name) and a one-sentence `description`.
- **Illustrate each how-to step with its clean screenshot from §2**, never a mistake/error-state
  capture. The published page can't load images from local disk or the Chrome session — base64-
  encode each PNG and inline it as a `data:image/png;base64,...` `<img>` next to its step. Skip a
  step's image only if no clean screenshot exists for it; never substitute an error-state one.
- Report the published URL in the terminal alongside the report's path — it isn't written into the
  report file, and it isn't one of the pipeline's `.claude/` artifacts.

**Never spawn a subagent for this.** Once the grading in §1–§4 is done, load `artifact-design`,
write the HTML, and publish it with the `Artifact` tool yourself, in this session, using the
plan's title/acceptance criteria, the base64-encoded screenshots per step, and the rules above
(audience, voice, what never to mention). Print the published URL alongside the report's path.

## 6 — End-to-end mode (`--e2e`)

Replaces §3–§5 for this invocation. §1 (get the app running), §2 (persona) and §2b (every avenue)
still apply, applied per-flow below.

### 6.1 — Cost checkpoint (every run, before touching the app)

- Read `.claude/maps/index.md` (container-level in a workspace) and count the domains and the
  flows listed under each.
- State that count out loud, and that a full-persona pass (§2's mistake-then-correct pattern, per
  step) **plus one `ui-ux-pro-max` expert critique per domain** (§3b/§6.2) across every one of them
  is a large, multi-domain spend — the same escalation checkpoint `pipeline-contract.md`'s
  cost-discipline section requires before any multi-x jump. Naming only the domain/flow count and
  leaving out the per-domain critique understates what's actually being approved.
- State the required model floor from §0b in the same breath — `--e2e` needs at least Sonnet 5,
  Opus 5 **required** (not just recommended) past ~5 domains. If the session is below the floor for
  the domain count just counted, stop here and ask the user to switch (`/model`) before continuing.
- **Ask before proceeding.** This runs every time, regardless of how few domains the map has —
  `--e2e` *is* the multi-x jump that checkpoint exists for, not a case that might be small enough
  to skip it.
- **Below the Opus floor for the domain count just named → offer the split-execution alternative
  (§0b) before falling back to scoping down.** Run §6.2's per-domain coverage one domain at a time
  under Sonnet 5 — same content a `--domain` run would produce: coverage, issues, and that domain's
  UI/UX rating — collecting each domain's findings and clean screenshots as you go. Once every
  domain is covered, ask the user to switch to Opus 5, then run §6.3's cross-domain journey and
  §6.4/§6.5's consolidated report + `ONBOARDING.md` refresh under Opus 5, folding in the
  Sonnet-collected per-domain sections rather than re-grading them. Note in the consolidated
  report's header that per-domain coverage ran under split execution. If the user declines this
  too, fall back to switching the whole run to Opus 5, or scoping down to specific `--domain` runs
  instead of a partial `--e2e`.

### 6.2 — Per-domain coverage

Apply §2's persona and §2b's every-avenue coverage to every `## Flow:` in every domain the index
lists — same mistake-then-correct pattern per step as single-feature mode, same
exercised/partial/unreachable tracking as §3. Rate
each domain with §3b's UI/UX rating too — persona score plus the `ui-ux-pro-max` expert critique
against that domain's clean screenshots. `--e2e` has no single plan behind any one domain, so the
Design Direction check is always "n/a" here — never invented.

**Under split execution** (§0b/§6.1), this section runs once per domain as its own Sonnet-5 pass —
same coverage, issues and UI/UX rating content as above, just scored and run separately rather than
as part of one aggregate Opus-tier session. Carry each domain's findings and clean screenshots
forward to §6.3-6.5 rather than re-deriving them once the session switches to Opus 5.

### 6.3 — Cross-domain journey

Run `map.mjs edges` for candidate couplings between domains (shared auth, a sequential business
process, shared queue/topic or route names). **Confirm a candidate is real before building a
journey on it** — per `pipeline-contract.md`, edges are candidates, not conclusions, and the same
string can appear in two domains by coincidence. Cover **every** confirmed edge a real user's
session would actually cross (not just one — the same every-avenue standard §2b sets within a
single feature applies across domains here too), drive each start to finish through the UI, and
apply §2's persona at each step exactly as any other flow. A candidate that doesn't hold up gets
said so in the report, not a journey built on it anyway.

### 6.4 — Report

Write one consolidated report: `.claude/reports/KEVIN_REPORT_e2e-<ISO date>.md` (container-level
for a workspace) — a new dated file every run; past runs stay on disk.

```markdown
# Kevin E2E Report
URL: <base-url>   Generated: <ISO date>

## Verdict
<one line: usable / confusing in places / broken>

## Domains
### <domain>
<same Coverage + Issues structure as §3/§4, scoped to this domain>
<same UI/UX Rating structure as §4, Design Direction line fixed to "n/a — e2e mode">

### <domain>
...

## Cross-domain journey: <name>
<same Coverage + Issues structure, for the chained journey — repeat this section once per confirmed edge, or write "none confirmed" and why if none held up>

## Correction Plan
1. [repo] [domain] <atomic fix — area if inferable, what, why>
2. [repo] [domain] [UI/UX] <atomic fix, from a concrete expert-critique violation only>
3. ...
```

Severity definitions (Critical/Confusing/Minor) are unchanged from §4.

### 6.5 — Onboarding doc (replaces §5 for this mode)

`--e2e`'s audience deliverable is a living guide, not a one-off announcement — refreshed every run
rather than published once per feature.

- **Regenerate `<repo-or-container-root>/ONBOARDING.md`** — repo root for a single repo, the
  container root for a workspace. Unlike every other pipeline artifact, **this file is not
  gitignored**: it is meant to be checked in and read by people, not tooling.
- Source it the way §5 sources its announcement: each domain's map functional description (title,
  flows, purpose) — never the Issues section, the Correction Plan, or source files.
- One section per domain (what it does, how to use it, numbered everyday steps), plus a short
  section for the cross-domain journey. No internal jargon, no mention of testing, QA, kevin,
  screenshots-as-evidence, severities, or file paths — same voice as §5's announcement.
- **Illustrate with clean screenshots** the same way §5 does: inline as base64
  `data:image/png;base64,...`, one per major step, skipped only where no clean screenshot exists —
  never substitute an error-state one.
- **Publish/republish it as an Artifact, reusing the same URL every run:**
  - First run: publish it, then write the URL into a hidden HTML comment at the very top of the
    file: `<!-- kevin-e2e-artifact: <url> -->`.
  - Every later run: read that comment before publishing, pass its URL to the Artifact tool so the
    same page updates in place, and leave the comment as-is unless the URL genuinely changed.
  - Publishing fails or is unavailable → say so, leave the comment untouched, keep the file on
    disk. The file is the deliverable; the Artifact is a convenience, same as `map-codebase`'s
    maps.

**Never spawn a subagent for this.** Same reasoning as §5: the domain grading is done by this
point, so draft/regenerate `ONBOARDING.md` and publish it yourself, in this session, using each
domain's map functional description, the screenshots, the existing artifact-comment URL (if any),
and the voice/content rules above. Perform the read-before-republish yourself before publishing.

**Watch your own context on this one.** This is the pipeline's heaviest brief: every domain's
description plus every screenshot, in a mode that only runs when there are many domains. Encoded
screenshots are the bulk of it. If it risks overflowing the session's context, work through it
domain by domain — draft and stage each domain's section, then assemble and publish once all are
ready — rather than trying to hold every domain's screenshots in context at once.

## Common mistakes

- Reading the File Impact Manifest, a listed file, or the diff "just to understand the feature."
- Skipping the deliberate-mistake pass on a step because the happy path is faster to run through.
- Editing `localStorage`, cookies, or calling an API directly to get past a stuck screen.
- Reporting "broken" with no reproduction steps a developer could actually replay.
- Submitting real payment, email, or SMS targets instead of asking for a safe one first.
- Declaring full coverage when a step was actually unreachable — mark it unreachable, don't skip
  it silently.
- Running one correct-usage-only pass and calling it done — the mistake pass is the point.
- Naming this skill, the report, or testing/QA/bugs anywhere in the published feature announcement.
- Skipping the feature announcement, or drawing its content from the Issues/Correction Plan instead
  of the plan's acceptance criteria.
- Declaring a native mobile frontend unreachable without first checking `adb devices` for a
  connected handset or emulator.
- Reading a `--domain` map's `## Structure` paths as files to open — same shortcut §2 forbids for
  a plan's manifest, just from a different document.
- Skipping the §6.1 cost checkpoint because the map only has a handful of domains — it runs every
  time, not past some threshold.
- Naming only the domain/flow count in §6.1 and leaving out the per-domain `ui-ux-pro-max` critique
  cost, or running `--e2e` (or grading a High-complexity plan) under a model below the §0b floor
  instead of telling the user and asking them to switch.
- Running split execution's §6.3 journey or §6.4/§6.5 consolidation under Sonnet 5 — the Opus floor
  still applies to that step even after per-domain coverage ran cheaper. Equally, running §6.2's
  per-domain coverage under Opus 5 when split execution already qualifies each pass for Sonnet 5's
  flat `--domain` floor is needless spend the other way.
- Writing `ONBOARDING.md` from the Issues section or Correction Plan instead of each domain's
  functional description.
- Publishing a fresh Artifact URL for `ONBOARDING.md` every run instead of reading the existing
  `kevin-e2e-artifact` comment back and republishing in place.
- Adding `ONBOARDING.md` to `.gitignore` — every other pipeline artifact is ignored; this one is
  deliberately not.
- Running the ui-ux-pro-max expert critique against a mistake/error-state screenshot instead of a
  clean one — it would be critiquing a fault state, not the design.
- Inventing a Design Direction comparison when the plan has none, or in `--domain`/`--e2e` mode
  where there's no plan at all — mark it "n/a," don't guess one up.
- Letting a subjective style preference from the expert critique become a Correction Plan entry —
  only a concrete violation (accessibility guideline, Design Direction mismatch) earns one.
- Treating one legitimate route through a step as full coverage when the step actually offers more
  than one (a shortcut, a bulk equivalent, an alternate valid input) — §2b requires trying each.
- Grading each acceptance criterion in isolation and never running the complete flow start to
  finish in one continuous pass.
- Skipping §3c's interacting-features check, or stopping at the first confirmed edge instead of
  covering every one — same for §6.3's cross-domain journey in `--e2e` mode.
- Building §3c's or §6.3's interaction check on a `map.mjs edges` candidate without confirming it's
  a real coupling first.

## Next step

If the Correction Plan is non-empty, `/execute-plan` consumes it — from any mode, including
`--domain` and `--e2e`. Name it; do not invoke it.
