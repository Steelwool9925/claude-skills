# cleanup-crew

Take finished work sitting in a dirty working tree and turn it into a clean, pushed feature
branch ready for a pull request.

Execute the steps **in this exact order**. Steps marked **HARD PAUSE** stop and wait for the
user — do not run the next git command until they answer.

## Scope — one repo or several

Run `map.mjs workspace` first.

- **Exit 4** — a single repo. Follow steps 0–7 once, exactly as written.
- **Exit 0** — a workspace. Determine which repos have uncommitted changes (`git status --short`
  in each) and confirm the set with the user before touching anything. Then follow
  *Cross-repo mode* below.

### Cross-repo mode

**One branch name across every affected repo, confirmed per repo.**

1. Ask for the base branch and the new branch name **once** — steps 2 and 3 below, asked a single
   time and applied everywhere. A shared name is what makes the set identifiable later; without it
   nobody can find the four branches that make up one feature.
2. Then, **for each affected repo in turn**, run steps 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 in full — including the
   commit confirmation. **Never batch the approvals.** One approval must not cover a diff you
   have not shown.
3. Any repo may be **skipped or aborted** without affecting the others. Say clearly what that
   leaves behind.
4. Finish with a summary table: repo, branch, commit hash, push result, PR URL.

**Partial completion is expected and is not an error.** If repo 3 fails, repos 1 and 2 stay
pushed. Report that plainly — do not attempt to unwind commits in other repositories, which is
far more dangerous than the partial state. Tell the user exactly which repos landed and which did
not, so they can finish or revert deliberately.

**Deployment ordering is not branch ordering.** The plan may require the backend to deploy first;
that says nothing about the order you commit in. Do not reorder repos on your own initiative.

## 0 — Drift preflight

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/map-codebase/map.mjs verify              # single repo
node ~/.claude/skills/map-codebase/map.mjs verify --workspace  # every repo in the workspace
```

Exit 0 → continue silently. Exit 1 → the architecture maps cite files that no longer exist. Warn
the user, show the drift, and offer `/map-codebase --update` before continuing. This check costs
no model tokens, so it runs every time.

If the repo has no maps, the check passes trivially. Do not treat that as a failure.

## 1 — Stash current changes

```bash
git status --short
```

If there are uncommitted changes:

```bash
git stash push -u
```

`-u` includes untracked files. If the tree is clean, say so and skip to step 2 — there may still
be a branch worth creating.

## 2 — Base branch selection — **HARD PAUSE**

Ask, verbatim:

> Which branch should we branch off of? (e.g. main, develop)

**WAIT.** Do not proceed until the user gives a branch name. Then:

```bash
git checkout <base_branch>
git pull
```

If `git pull` fails (no upstream, diverged history, auth), stop and surface the error. Do not
continue onto a stale base.

## 3 — Feature branch creation — **HARD PAUSE**

Ask, verbatim:

> What should the new feature branch be named?

**WAIT.** Then:

```bash
git checkout -b <new_branch>
```

## 4 — Apply the stash — **HARD PAUSE on any conflict**

```bash
git stash pop
git status
```

**On any conflict, STOP and ask.** Show the conflicted files and both sides, and wait for the
user to decide per file.

This skill does **not** auto-resolve in favour of the stashed changes. Silently discarding a
change that was pulled from the base branch seconds earlier — a teammate's fix, a dependency
bump, a migration — is not an acceptable default, and the person best placed to judge is the one
who wrote both. Resolve only what the user directs, then confirm the working tree is clean and
the changes applied.

If `git stash pop` fails for any other reason, abort and surface the error. Never drop a stash to
"clean things up".

## 5 — Docs refresh

**README.md** — update it to reflect the changes just applied: accurate description, setup and
usage, structure. If the project has none, create one. If it is badly out of date, bring it into
line rather than bolting a note on the end.

**changes.md** — an untracked, append-only changelog at the project root:

1. Ensure `changes.md` is listed in `.gitignore`; add the entry if missing.
2. Ask the user for the ticket number(s) for this change. Remember them for step 7.
3. **Append** — never overwrite — a dated entry. Get the date from `date +%Y-%m-%d`:

```
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — <ticket(s)>
- <change 1>
- <change 2>
```

## 6 — Summarise and gather context — **HARD PAUSE**

Analyse the applied changes. Write a **detailed but brief** summary of which files changed and
the overall feature or fix implemented. Show it to the user, then ask:

> Please provide any task links or ticket references (e.g. ADO, Jira) to include in the commit
> message, or type 'none'.

**WAIT.** Skip the ask only if step 5 already captured the ticket numbers — in that case, show
them and confirm.

## 7 — Commit and push — **HARD PAUSE before committing**

Show the staged file list for confirmation first, then compose the commit with **three** `-m`
flags in this exact structure:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<title of the changes>" -m "<short description of all the changes>" -m "<tickets as #<number>, space-delimited>"
git push -u origin <new_branch>
```

- 1st `-m`: concise title of the changes.
- 2nd `-m`: short description of all the changes.
- 3rd `-m`: each ticket as `#<number>`, space-delimited — e.g. `#123 #456`. If the user said
  'none', omit the third flag rather than committing an empty one.

**Show the fully composed command and get approval before running it.** Then report the commit
hash, the push result, and any remote branch or PR URL git prints.

## Guardrails

- **Never force-push.**
- **Never push to `main` or `master`.** The push targets the new feature branch, by its own name.
- Abort and surface the error if `git stash pop` fails unexpectedly, if this is not a git repo,
  or if the working-tree state is unclear.
- Only commit after showing the composed command and getting approval.
- `git add -A` stages everything — show the file list first so the user can catch stray artifacts
  before they land in the commit.

## Common mistakes

- Auto-resolving a stash conflict instead of asking. Step 4 is a hard pause for a reason.
- Running `git checkout` before the user has named the base branch.
- Committing without showing the composed command.
- **Taking one approval as consent to commit in several repos.** Confirm per repo, every time.
- **Using a different branch name per repo.** The shared name is what ties the set together.
- Attempting to unwind commits already pushed to other repos when one repo fails.
- Committing generated output in one repo without the source change that produced it.
- Overwriting `changes.md` instead of appending.
- Committing `changes.md` — it must stay gitignored.
- Skipping the drift preflight because "it's probably fine". It is free.

## End of the pipeline

This is the last stage. The branch is pushed; open the pull request from here.
